### Usage
Please note that this program is very ressources-heavy and needs to be compiled as release, not in debug.
By default, the program uses bunny.obj, it should take between 1 to 5 minutes to calculate the laplacian
and the eigenvectors, but once that is done, every algorithm can be easily tested without difficulty.
If time is an issue, please change the input on line 140 to a smaller mesh.

Open the source folder as a project in an IDE. (preferably visual studio) Then compile main.cpp.
At execution, there will be a console with very simple instructions on how to operate the program.

If any technical problems are encountered, I included an executable program in
source\out\executable\X64 which only requires a windows machine and a double mouse click to operate.
